# Inquire into Gestalt Principles:

This one in particular by Steve Bradley:
http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/gestalt-principles-of-perception/
and maybe Steve Bradley’s book:
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-ofgestalt/
/ see pdf of some pages.
Also this one: Gestalt Theory in Typography & Design Principles

Then possibly these???

From the wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology page:
Gestalt psychology or gestaltism (German: Gestalt [ɡəˈʃtalt] "shape, form") is a theory of mind
of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology tries to understand the laws of
our ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central
principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies.
This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or gestalt,
the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt
psychologist Kurt Koffka, "The whole is other than the sum of the parts" is often incorrectly
translated [1] as "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" and thus used when explaining gestalt
theory, and further incorrectly applied to systems theory.[2] Koffka did not like the translation. He
firmly corrected students who replaced "other" by "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he
said.[3] The whole has an independent existence.
In the domain of perception, Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products of
complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the behaviorist approach to understanding
the elements of cognitive processes, gestalt psychologists sought to understand their organization
(Carlson and Heth, 2010). The gestalt effect is the capability of our brain to generate whole forms,
particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of
simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves...).
In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism. Gestalt theory allows for the breakup of
elements from the whole situation into what it really is.[4]
