## For Week 2
Design 48 flags, print to plotter at actual size (flags should be 3 x 4.5"). Do not trim flags, but you may need to put a background shade for us to see the edges.

Printing instructions appear [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzGo6I72eF2HU1B2SXRuRnpYcEk?usp=sharing). Print using Acrobat after you export a pdf from Illustrator. 

Upload one flag to [flagtest.nz](http://flagtest.nz/) and have open on your laptop for walkabout.

### For Week 3
Stay tuned...
