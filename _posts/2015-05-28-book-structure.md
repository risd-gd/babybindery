While the webpage structures are mutable to your needs, the print.html and layouts is special.

In it, a fixed number of pages are generated (you can change this number by editing `_config.yml`). Thereâ€™s a lot of nesting to keep track of details, and this is the list from outside in: 
`.sheet`, `.page`, `.content-wrapper`, then either one or two `.page-content` (which can help facilitate a two-column layout), then `.content` divs that have content flowed into them. 

All of the content comes from `book.html`.
