## Course Overview
Graphic design occupies an ever-expanding, ever-redefined territory at the intersection of verbal and visual languages. Its media spans everything from websites to postcards, film to signage, typefaces to billboards. Its methods make use of both sides of the brain: pairing  logic, critical analysis, research, and planning with intuitive search, mark-making and visual expression. Graphic designers are inquirers, observers, poets, editors, curators, analysts, researchers, commentators, and critics.

Rather than attempt to codify this expansive landscape, or to delineate a sequential path through it, this course takes this ambiguity as license for experimentation, discovery, and play. You will encounter and engage the tools, materials, and processes of graphic design in functional context,
as means to self-directed ends.

The emphasis will be on methodologies of making — observation, analysis, ideation, translation, curation, research — and on developing a personal voice and approach.

Design Studio will take the form of a series of question-based units, each initiated by a faculty member and contextualized by a presentation, event, or workshop. Units may span the entire term, a few weeks, or a single class period. Design Studio is a fast-paced course that necessitates a self-directed, open-ended, experimental and playful mindset. Units will not define outcomes or prescribe processes, but rather will aim to inspire lines of enquiry, challenging students to explore unfamiliar subject matter, tools, media, and processes by their own initiative.

Something specific to DS1.

## DS1 Units

### Unit 01:	John Caserta

#### What do you value in what you see – and how can you communicate it to those who weren’t there?

Designers often work with unfamiliar content, environments and contexts. An essential skill for the designer is to make sense of what she sees, and then communicate it clearly back to others. How do you distill or find meaning in what is already there? And how can you make use of it? Placed within the context of a design process, this is defined as observational research, assessing what is before anything is to be done.

### Unit 02:	Lucinda Hitchcock

#### How can you alter an existing space to create narrative?

Although graphic design exists in a multitude of places, spaces, and surfaces, it is often considered to be mostly a two-dimensional enterprise. But in fact our work is often multi-dimensional dealing with everything from space-making, wayfinding, and system design to exhibit design, information environments, and complex networks and interfaces. Here you will play with various materials, forms, scales, and associations as you introduce design into chosen or designated spaces/places.

Unit 03	Tom Ockerse
	How can the graphic medium
	enhance and enrich the
	verbal message?
In our engagement with the world around us, and our routine to make sense out of complexity, we take for granted the perceptual principles this interaction involves. We will look into the power of graphic design to discover how an abstract (non-visual) object like a “word” (a verbal means to represent an idea) can be enriched significantly toward a deep sense of poetic insight due to its graphic/visual delivery, and thus provide a lasting impression of value for the ideas it holds.

Unit 04	Michelle Bowers
	How can collaboration be a catalyst
	for making?
Collaboration is important across many fields of creative work and the discoveries made through it can be invaluable. This unit promotes methods that emphasize teamwork, spontaneity and responsiveness. You will see how methods of shared creativity can produce a form of knowledge that is experiential and intuitive. Beginning with a collaborative writing process, students will start to recognize emerging relationships upon which to build work, and from which to proceed into unexpected territory.

Unit 05	Thomas Wedell
	How can time be communicated?
One of the main concepts necessary to understanding the design process is the use of time. In our discipline, time plays an even bigger role — not only in how we engage in the design of an exhibit or screen based project, but also in the considerations we must build into two-dimensional “fixed” surfaces, such as signs, books, posters, and charts. Today’s designer must learn to master pacing. How a viewer encounters a sequence of events, and the pace that those events are viewed, forms one of the basic elements of communication.

Grading

Grades in D.S. do not emphasize end products, but the necessary work that leads to successful end products. Evidence of the below are visible in process blog, sketchbook, completion of units as directed by the faculty:

20% 	Contribution
	Attendance,
participation, motivation and personal commitment

20% 	Inquiry
	Search, research, study, and networking of knowledge and insights

20% 	Breadth
	Range of experience, willingness to experiment, take risks and broaden horizons

20%	Depth
	Attention to the quality of ideas, critical thought and authenticity and voice

20% 	Finish
	Demonstration of skills in craft, visual design, presentation and communication

Attendance

Students should arrive on time and prepared for
each class. Three unexcused absences will result
in failure of the course.

Etiquette

Please turn off all
cell phones — no txting or emailing during class.
