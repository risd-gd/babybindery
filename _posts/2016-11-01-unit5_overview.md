# For next week, November 8

Bring a favourite piece of graphic design (for example, a book, logo, poster, record cover, website, app, calendar, magazine, etc.) to class next week, ready to show in class after James Gogginâ€™s unit kick-off. Think about why you love this particular piece (for example, the use if provides, its visual qualities, its emotional resonance) and be prepared to share both it and your thoughts about it with your section in class.
