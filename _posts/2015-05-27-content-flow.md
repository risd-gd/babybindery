1. Raw content (in html, txt, md, etc filetypes) turns into a site, generated by Jekyll.
2. On the book page of babybindery, all of the site content is dropped into one DOM element, with the CSS property ‘flow-into: flow-name’.
3. CSS Regions Polyfill takes all of the content in this DOM element into the flow, and then hides the element.
4. The content from the flow is poured through a series of content areas with CSS property ‘flow-from: flow-name’. We have these content areas inset in .page objects, so that each fills a typical content container on a printed page.
