# Consider these questions while taking notes


Identify which films satisfy this

Did the video show you how to do the thing?

Did the structure of the video assist or “overwhelm” the intended narrative?

How successful was the use of “graphic devices” (numbers, arrows, etc.)?

Did the video use the time allotment (two minutes or less) to advantage?

Did the video use camera angles, cutting, close ups, continuity, and an effective compositional structure to advantage?

Was there a sense of distinct voice?

Which 1-3 films do you want to discuss/remember?
