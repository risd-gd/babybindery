We anticipated three content types: “Conversations” (a generalized interview), “Images” (appropriate for show catalogues or portfolios), and “Text” (catchall text-based content). There’s also “Other” on by default.

If you seek to shrink or expand this list, start in _config.yml and simply edit the variable `content-types`.

(Additionally, you should prepare web layouts for the new content that reflects its metadata and such.)

Reminder: you must rebuild if you make a change to _config.yml to see the changes appear.
