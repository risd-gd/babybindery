We anticipated three content types: “Conversations” (a generalized interview), “Images” (appropriate for show catalogues or portfolios), and “Text” (catchall text-based content). There’s also “Other” on by default. 

If you seek to shrink or expand this list, start in `_config.yml` and simply edit the variable `content-types`. If you want a multi-word content type, please wrap it in quotes in `_config.yml`, but don’t wrap it in quotes in your post files. 

Reminder: you must rebuild if you make a change to _config.yml to see the changes appear. 

And as a final point: layouts and content-types do not need to be one and the same!
