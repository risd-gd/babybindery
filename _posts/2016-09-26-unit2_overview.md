# Unit 02: Tom Ockerse


## Question: How can the graphic medium *enhance and enrich* the verbal message?

In our engagement with the world around us, and our routine to “make sense” out of complexity, we
take for granted the perceptual and holistic principles this interaction involves. That perception of
parts and configurations as a holistic system, or language, depends greatly on the use of socalled
“gestalt” principles (i.e., figure-ground, similarity, closure, etc.) and how these serve the
purpose to communicate. Since graphic design presents ideas primarily via graphic means, awareness
of these perceptual principles is critical for designers to help their products stimulate clarity and unity,
curiosity and interest, inquiry and insight. We will look into this power of graphic design to discover
how an abstract (non-visual) object like a “word” (a verbal means to represent an idea) can be
enriched significantly toward a deep sense of poetic insight due to its graphic/visual delivery, and thus
provide a lasting impression of value for the ideas it holds.

## Learning Objectives:

• Develop visual sensibilities
• Learn about “gestalt” principles and their holistic system as “language”
• Observe the power of the visual to affect the non-visual
• Develop mind-mapping skills
• Become aware of the practice to design for experience


## Week 3

### PHASE 1: Find your word

After introducing this unit each participant is given an object (same for all). Return to your studio.
There, work individually to mind map your identity with the object (what it means to you).*
After about 15 minutes of mind mapping select a single word from your map (subjectively,
for whatever reason, or needing to connect to the object).

**Note: work only with this word for the next two weeks.**

Continue to work in class on the next phase (below) to write/typeset/draw the word.



### PHASE 2  

Phase 2: experience the writing/typesetting/presenting the word: see, feel, experience the
letterforms, and tools, materials; inquire into options for “writing”: tools, methods, structures, spacetime,
dimensions, letter/forms, qualities and gestalt principles.
Work quickly to explore visual form, and to generate a variety that uncover options.
Again: use only this one word: its letters, forms, structures, configurations.
Also: inquire into “gestalt” principles (web sites) and their applications in your work.


### PHASE 3

After your studies of visual forms *explore the meaning of your word* via a NEW
mind map; i.e., define an expanded sense and depth of meaning that is *of interests to you*.

### PHASE 4

Then (still only *using ONLY the word*) continue to explore how the visual means can
embed the meaning of interest to you into the word’s graphic presentation via: *visual qualities
for its elements* (letter/forms), their per/**form**/ance, and the experience others can have with it.
Begin in simple ways. Write the word (with an adjective in mind) and search to harmonize meaning of
the verbal and visual. Consider actions, visual expressions, configurations of parts, gestalt principles,
etc.

At the start of next week’s class present your ideas and your process for inquiry in an organized fashion via in a quick, efficient method to help the group get into the depth of your work, the value of your search, and appreciate the results.

### PHASE 5

After reviews continue to work in class on the next phase to further experiment with the means for your word to represent a depth of meaning and heightened (poetic) potential. Work to optimize results to truly invite others to experience the word for its most meaningful, poetic potential.

**Reflect**: during each week’s process take pause to reflect. Make written notes. Become aware of
your curiosities, interests, and questions for inquiry. Especially note the many ways the visual
implicates
