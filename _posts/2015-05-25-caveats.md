Babybindery is still fragile in some spots. 

Some things to avoid:

- Complex embeds & iframes in your content.
- Editing line-height. (this breaks polyfill regions’ ability to find the “bottom” of each region, so content spills everywhere).
- Editing content margins or forcing page-breaks. Just embrace this funky web-ey look and use padding, please. 

The connection between book.html and what actually prints out is tenuous; we suggest doing your best to make the book preview at book.html look as you’d like it, and we’ll do our best to make sure it prints like that. 

If you have ideas on how we might be able to inject spreads into the book, cleanly and consistently… drop us a line.
