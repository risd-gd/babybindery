# Design Studio 1 Reflective Document

As we near the end of the course reflect on your DS1 experiences,
your inquiries and work, course content and methods, and what you learned.
Then develop a written and illustrated overview of your experiences that reflects:
on the whole course and your design process for each Unit.
While NOT meant as a mere step-by-step “report” of your process (albeit inherent to include)
DO SO in a reflective manner:

* that examines what you did and why,
* that notes experiments and failures,
* that critically evaluates developments and results,
* that speculates on what could improve results.

Describe your interests, criticism, enthusiasm, relational views, and insights gained!
Of course, your daily/weekly “reflections” can weave into this.
